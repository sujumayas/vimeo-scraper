    "url": "https://vimeo.com/404106080",
    "description": "By the 1920s, Oklahoma was home to some 50 African-American towns, in addition to a large and prosperous black community living in the city of Tulsa. These towns and their self-reliant middle class and affluent residents are documented by the home movies of Reverend S. S. Jones, an itinerant minister and businessman. Known and respected by the citizens of the towns whose lives he captured on film, Rev. Jones’s work offers revealing glimpses of these communities as a haven for African Americans who very often faced discrimination elsewhere in America. The subjects are everyday life: a family on the front porch of their bungalow, shop workers at a storefront, farmers plowing their fields, children playing on seesaws in a schoolyard. Much of the material documents the economic life of the towns, from business districts filled with prosperous merchants to the homes of successful professionals, with an abundant countryside beyond. As Rhea Combs, curator of film and photography for the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, points out in her commentary, here we even find a married couple who were oil barons, proof of the extraordinary progress made in the relatively short time since the end of slavery. The fashions and hairstyles, automobiles and horses, and even such details as a man manually pumping gasoline at a filling station make the films a fascinating record of the lives of Americans, and African Americans in particular, in the early 20th century. ➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe  About National Geographic: National Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Egypt produces the most popular cinema in the Middle East and, after Hollywood and India, produces more movies than any other country in the world. The Egyptian Filmmakers have produced masterpieces since 1920s. Now all these films are in great danger. Egypt has no film preservation facilities to preserve these great movies.\nEgyptian Films are representation of this great culture and are extensions of the work of the ancient Egyptians who used drawing and painting to represent the society of that time visually. These same films are generally unheard of in the United States and it is our hope that along with preservation of these films, a greater audience and thus appreciation would be achieved.\n\"إنقاذ كلاسيكيات السينما المصرية\" اهمال الأفلام في غرف التخزين دون الحفظ.عليها. مصر تنتج السينما الأكثر شعبية في الشرق الأوسط، بعد هوليوود والهند، صناع السينما المصرية أنتجو روائع منذ 1920s. الآن كل هذه الأفلام في خطر. مصر لا يوجد لديه مرافق للحفاظ علي الافلام أو الترميم.\nمنذ عشر سنوات تسربت إلي مصر كتيبة مالية قامت بشراء تراث السينما المصرية بالكامل أن أكثر من4000 فيلم أنتجتها مصر في مائة عام تم بيعها بتراب الفلوس في ذلك الوقت .. واستطاعت رؤوس الأموال العربية أن تصادر تاريخ مصر السينمائي. \nلقد شهدت السنوات الماضية أكبر الجرائم في تاريخ تراث مصر الفني سواء في السينما .. تم بيع أصول جميع الأفلام المصرية والمسئولون عندنا في حالة نوم عميق وغشاوة أفقدتهم القدرة علي أن يوقفوا هذه الكارثة بأي صورة من الصور .. تم تهريب جميع أفلام جريدة مصر السينمائية إلي أكثر من جهة بينها إسرائيل،وهي تمثل أهم وأخطر ذاكرة للأحداث الكبري في كل المجالات .. ولا أحد يعرف كيف تم تهريب هذه الوثائق التاريخية الهامة والتي جمعت رموز مصر في مائة عام منذ بدأت هذه الجريدة صدورها في الاسكندرية في عام 1912 علي يد المصور الفرنسي دي لاجارن.. أن الأحداث الهامة في تاريخ مصرتم تسجيلها في الجريدة السينمائية منذ عودة سعد زغلول من منفاه .. كيف تسرب هذا التاريخ وما هي العصابات التي قامت بذلك .",

Egypt produces the most popular cinema in the Middle East and, after Hollywood and India, produces more movies than any other country in the world. The Egyptian Filmmakers have produced masterpieces since 1920s. Now all these films are in great danger. Egypt has no film preservation facilities to preserve these great movies.",

    "description": "Hello!! This is my very first video uploaded to Vimeo.\nIt is both kind of a videoclip and videoart. The idea was born of two things:\n- The Jam's song \"Town called malice\", published in 1982 by Polydor Records...\nAnd:\n- The TV's channel TCM Classic (Turner Classic Movies), which is a great TV channel for all cinema lovers.\n\nI first decided to make a video that mixed different visual and aesthetic styles, like punk's attitudes and non-talking movies of the 1920s, just to prove myself that these different styles could be unified in a great song: the one mentioned above, which was the principal inspiration during the shooting and editing of this little movie.\n\nThen I realised that \"Town called malice\" and TCM had the same beginning letters, so the film's name could not be other but \"TCM (Town Called Malice)\". \n\nDon't expect for a story to be told in it, it is just an \"exercise\", an aesthetic exercise which I loved doing.\n\nThough I know the edition could be better, I did it with the most accesible tool to me at that moment, with my laptop computer... but nice little things can be done with it (this proves that no big special effects are required to make big great movies. It is imagination and creativity that counts).\n\nI hope you'll like it as much as I did while filming it. I only counted on my dog's help! (and The Jam's help, of course, which was basic for everything else to come!).",

    "description": "Beginning with the German cinema of the 1920s and ending with contemporary films, this course provides a historical overview of influential German movies, major periods, and key filmmakers.\n \nIn the 1920s German cinema was one of Hollywood’s fiercest competitors, and the Ufa, Germany’s premier film studio, produced a body of innovative films that would become classics. Movies such as Nosferatu and Metropolis continue to influence filmmaking practices internationally. We will begin with a look at the cinema of the Weimar Republic (1919-1933) and the transition of silent film to sound film beginning with German cinema’s earliest sound film, The Blue Angel, the 1929 film that launched Marlene Dietrich into stardom.\n \nThe course then explores Nazi cinema (Leni Riefenstahl and Veit Harlan), the Hollywood films of German-speaking émigrés like Billy Wilder and Fritz Lang, postwar movies of West Germany, and the New German cinema. It looks at such topics as working through Germany’s fascist past (Rainer Werner Fassbinder), East German films, and then finally contemporary film and German unification (Florian von Donnersmarck and Fatih Akin). Given that German film is closely aligned with the history of the 20th century, the course relates the films to the social reality from which they emerged.\n \nBarbara Kosta received her Ph.D. in German from the University of California, Berkeley. She is the author of Recasting Autobiography: Women's Counterfictions in Contemporary German Literature and Film and coeditor of Writing Against Boundaries: Gender, Ethnicity and Nationality in the German-speaking Context. Her most recent book is  Willing Seduction: The Blue Angel, Marlene Dietrich, Mass Culture. Her research and teaching interests are Weimar cinema and visual culture, transnational cinema, contemporary literature and film, feminist theory, and cultural studies.",

    "description": "AVAILABLE ON DVD AT WWW.FLICKERALLEY.COM\n\nFlicker Alley, in collaboration with Blackhawk Films and Turner Classic Movies, is proud to present the astonishing Miss Mend, a 1926 three-part serial / adventure film from Soviet directors Boris Barnet and Fedor Ozep. Widely regarded by the official Soviet press of the time as a prime example of shameless “Western-style” entertainment, the serial was nevertheless hugely popular, becoming one of the most successful Soviet films of the 1920s. Miss Mend is an energetic, fast-moving serial which opens a window on the phenomenon of Soviet Americanism and reveals a little-known side of early Soviet cinema.\n\nMiss Mend, an action-packed adventure serial in three feature-length episodes, was produced in Russia with the goal of rivaling, and possibly even surpassing, the most entertaining American movies of the 1920s. Instead of the avant-garde works of Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov, Russian audiences were enchanted by fast-moving American films starring serial queens like Pearl White, swashbuckling heroes like Douglas Fairbanks, and comedians from the Keystone Cops to Lloyd, Keaton, and Chaplin. Miss Mend meets them all head-on and hardly stops for breath. It features beautiful location photography, impressive stunt scenes; horse, car and boat chases, radio towers, jazz bands and even a spectacular train wreck, interspersed with visual references to German film classics like Nosferatu, Caligari and Dr. Mabuse. The film’s heroine, Vivian Mend, is an elegant urban professional who earns her own living and raises a child without the help of any man. But the film, partially set in an imagined America where everything is new and progressive (from technology to social relations and lifestyles) also includes a few more-than-pointed comments on labor relations, racism, excessive wealth, gratuitous violence, and sexual assault.\n\nThis new edition was mastered in high definition from superb original 35mm elements produced by David Shepard and Jeffery Masino, with digital restoration and editing being carried out by Eric Lange of Lobster Films, Paris.",

They had to be \"turned into\" sardines at a factory within 24 hours as they spoiled quickly, so the step from herring to sardine was a quick one. Twenty years earlier than this summer day, there were sixty-eight weirs in the Bagaduce region. In the 1900's an industrial process was developed to turn the slurry of fish scales on the \"flumes\" into a pearly coating for plastic beads - and fake pearls were borne. Sardine men of the midcentury knew that Queen Elizabeth was crowned while wearing a necklace made of sardine scales. Transfer your home movies at: ww.oldfilm.org\n\nErnest G.

The grainy, sun-streaked films provide behind-the-scenes views of the family at their Hyannis Port and Palm Beach homes, and on trips to Europe and Asia. Featured are never-before-seen home movies by Robert, Ethel, and John F. Kennedy, all shot in a wonderfully off-the-cuff style. Interviews with family friends and distinguished historians contribute to this moving portrait of a larger-than-life American family, and highlight an era that Jacqueline Kennedy would later describe as “Camelot” – bright, brief, and now indelibly iconic. \n\nThe Lost Kennedy Home Movies is an SFM/Signal Hill Entertainment production, narrated by Liev Schreiber.",

He was best known for his silent films, in which his trademark was physical comedy with a consistentlystoic, deadpan expression, earning him the nickname \"The Great Stone Face\"\n\nBuster Keaton (his lifelong stage name) was recognized as the seventh-greatest director by Entertainment Weekly. In 1999, theAmerican Film Institute ranked Keaton the 21st-greatest male star. Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton's \"extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929, [when] he worked without interruption on a series of films that make him, arguably, the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies.\" His career declined afterward with a dispiriting loss of his artistic independence when he was hired by MGM, which resulted in a crippling alcoholism that ruined his family life. However, he recovered in the 1940s, remarried and revived his career to a degree as an honored comic performer for the rest of his life, earning an Academy Honorary Award in 1958.\nOrson Welles stated that Keaton's The General is \"the greatest comedy ever made, the greatest Civil War film ever made, and perhaps the greatest film ever made.\" A 2002 worldwide poll by Sight & Sound ranked Keaton's The General as the 15th best film of all time. Three other Keaton films received votes in the magazine's survey: Our Hospitality, Sherlock, Jr., and The Navigator.\n\nBuster Keaton #Wordpress:\nhttps://busterkeaton101.wordpress.com/\n\nBuster Keaton #Blogspot:\nhttp://buster-keaton-101.blogspot.com/\n\nBuster Keaton #Tumblr:\nhttp://buster-keaton-101.tumblr.com/\n\nBuster Keaton #Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/busterkeaton101\n\nBuster Keaton #Facebook Fanpage:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Unofficial-Buster-Keaton/495980173883338\n\nBuster Keaton #Pinterest:\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/hussain0605/buster-keaton/\n\nRelated Help:\nharold lloyd, diane keaton, michael keaton, buster keaton the general, buster keaton photos, buster keaton jr, eleanor norris, buster keaton stunts, Buster Keaton, Buster Keaton Movies,\nFOR MORE INFO CLICK URL BELOW:\nhttps://busterkeaton101.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/buster-keaton-afis-50-greatest-american-screen-legend/\n\nBuster Keaton #Youtube Video:\nhttp://youtu.be/T3OzhdKaqeU",

The screening will highlight collections shot on film by movie makers from the 1940s through the 1980s and will include new narrations recorded by the filmmakers and their families. The presentations will show how the Historical Society uses its home movie collections in its exhibits, and what films are being preserved by the Al Larvick Fund's biennial North Dakota grant. Through these homemade histories, we can recognize ourselves and our everyday lives but also be transported to less familiar times and places, showing us both intimate and ordinary family activities, as well as public events such as rodeos, parades, and town and farm life. The program will premiere online through the Historical Society’s YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUYGXh-bCjg) from October 23rd through November 6th, and will screen in the Great Plains Theatre at the Heritage Center in Bismarck from October 23rd through the 29th, 2021.",

It appears that they were shot between 1965 and 1968 or 1969.\n\nSome of the images are poorly shot in bad lighting. The Hernandez-Sada wedding reception in San Antonio was particularly difficult to recognize even the bride and groom. Still, images of playing football in the street outside of the rented house in Austin at 93 San Jacinto are clear. And there's one shot of sliding down the hill to the river on cardboard boxes.\n\nIn addition to Hernandez, we see Sada, Avila and Gonzalez family members. We also see street and neighborhood scenes of Chicago and Austin at various moments.\n\nA special remembrance to the late John \"Shotgun\" Hernandez who purchased the camera in the 1960s and was primarily responsible for the existence of this family record.",

Runtime 11 minutes.\n\n\nABOUT TANGO SILENT FILMS:\nTango Silent Films is a Portland-based film project dedicated to creating a series of short films inspired by traditional Argentine tango music since 2009. The films are short (7-10 minutes) and modeled after classic silent films, but with pepperings of modernity. They feature a motley cast of recurring characters who traipse through the Tango Silent Film world having adventures of love, ego and tango that are at once absurd and humorous, poignant, farcical and realistic, frivolous and profound.\n\nCONTACT: tangosilentfilms@gmail.com",

Steele and twenty other founding members. Mills, its current C.E.O. & president, remembers seeing an episode of \"Tony Brown's Journal\" on PBS in the mid-1980s devoted to early black cinema. He and the others spent the next decade and a half researching the history of black cinema in the United States. The idea to create a museum didn't materialize until the late '90s. Mills is on a mission to secure funds to display the vast collection, evidence of the largely untold history of black cinema, at a permanent establishment.\n\nPRODUCER BIO\nEmon Hassan, Narratively's Director of Video & Multimedia, is a New York-based filmmaker and photographer.

I teamed up with Brent Barbano from ShareGrid and Matthew Duclos from Duclos lenses and we set out to create the most thorough vintage lens comparison test possible. We had one weekend and a small crew, lead by DP Kyle Stryker to test out more than 40 individual lenses. I donated every lens in my inventory and we got a few additional sets generously donated for the weekend. It was an eye-opening experience and we hope that cinematographers and directors find it to be a valuable resource when it comes to choosing the right lens for a project. The finished library includes a quad-split video player to compare 4 lenses at once, a bokeh chart as well as other useful info.\n\nTest videos available at:\nblog.sharegrid.com/ultimate-vintage-cinema-lens-test\n\nIntro video Shot and Cut by \nBrent Barbano",

Sembène, who was also an acclaimed novelist in his native Senegal, transforms a deceptively simple plot—about a young Senegalese woman who moves to France to work for a wealthy white couple and finds that life in their small apartment becomes a figurative and literal prison—into a complex, layered critique on the lingering colonialist mindset of a supposedly postcolonial world. Featuring a moving central performance by Mbissine Thérèse Diop, Black Girl is a harrowing human drama as well as a radical political statement—and one of the essential films of the 1960s.",

    "description": "Black Francis To Release The Golem Rock Album + DVD\n\nOriginal Score To The Golem : How He Came Into The World\n\n Out November 16th Exclusively On Black Francis Web Store\n\nTHE GOLEM: HOW HE CAME INTO THE WORLD\nAn original score by BLACK FRANCIS\n\nOften regarded as the height of German expressionism, the silent, black and white film \"The Golem\" (also known in it's German form, \"Der Golem\") was the last of a series of three films by director Paul Wegener and was released in 1920.\n\nSet in the 16th century, \"The Golem: How He Came Into The World\" tells the story of the persecution of the Jews of Prague. The towns Rabbi (Rabbi Loew), foreseeing these events, constructs a giant 'Golem' out of clay in order to protect his people. Mayhem ensues when the creature rebels and begins to destroy the ghetto. The highly expressionistic imagery seen in the film was captured by legendary cinematographer Karl Freund, who went on to do the classic \"Metropolis\" in 1927. \n\nGroundbreaking as it was, the film sat 'silent' for nearly 88 years until the San Francisco International Film Festival requested Black Francis score the film and perform it live for their annual film festival in April, 2008. Despite the sold out show at San Francisco's Castro Theatre (with a line stretching around the block) the score has never been performed live since. However, BF recorded the resulting double album in a matter of days in SF at Hyde Street Studios, with help from longtime collaborator/producer Eric Drew Feldman. The album features Black Francis on vocals/guitar, the late Duane Jarvis on lead guitar, EDF on keys, Joseph Pope on bass, Jason Carter on drums and Ralph Carney on horns.\n\nIn early 2010 the double album, along with the recordings of the live performance in 2008 and the DVD was compiled into a special, limited edition booklet. Only 500 copies were released and sold exclusively through the Black Francis web store. \n\nHowever, November 16th, 2010 will see the release of The Golem 'rock album': a stunning one-hour 'rock opera' derived from the original 2-disc album. To accompany the album, the DVD with complete score (both housed in simple & elegant, eco-friendly packaging) will also be available exclusively through the Black Francis web store and Amazon.com.\n\nFor Press Inquiries Please Contact Kip@TellAllYourFriendsPR.com",

    "description": "KANDIDATO (1949). A comedy about small-town politics in 1949, starring the incomparable Pugo and Togo. The comic duo, trained to improvise dialogue on stage during the Japanese occupation (when the movie industry was shut down), took the gist of the dialogue in films and proceeded to just improvise their lines.  During the Japanese Occupation, their names were changed to Puging at Tuging because one of the top Japanese admirals was named Admiral Togo. Japanese soldiers were enamored by wristwatches and confiscated the watches of any Filipino they saw wearing one. In one stage presentation, Pugo and Togo appeared on stage with their arms covered in wristwatches. The Japanese in the audience did not find this funny and for this the two comedians were hauled off by the Japanese Kempetai to Fort Santiago. \n\nDirected by Joe Climaco. Starring Pugo and Togo, Tony Arnaldo and Vida Florante. Supported by Tinno De Lara, Florentino Ballecer, Horace Curry, Chuchi Hernandez, Armando Canseco, Ven Medina, Resty Salas, Pablo Virtuoso and Victor Salvador. Cinematography by Ray Lacap.

    "description": "The 1980s were defined by style and excess, and the era’s horror movies were no exception. Innovations in practical effects made the nightmares more vivid than ever, and thanks to the rise of home video, the call was now coming from inside the house. While established talents such as John Carpenter (PRINCE OF DARKNESS), Tobe Hooper (THE FUNHOUSE), David Cronenberg (SCANNERS), Michael Mann (THE KEEP), and Paul Schrader (CAT PEOPLE) brought terrifying spectacles to the screen, often with the help of Hollywood studios, home video opened up a new market that allowed the independents to take the genre to unexpected and—in the case of the UK’s censorship of infamous “Video Nasties”—controversial new heights. Curated by Clyde Folley, this ghastly tour through the decade of greed features ambitious art-pulp hybrids (WHITE OF THE EYE), a Hitchcock-inspired trucker movie (ROAD GAMES), old-fashioned creature features (Q: THE WINGED SERPENT), a vampiric Nicolas Cage (VAMPIRE'S KISS), and absolutely unclassifiable cult oddities (SOCIETY), bringing together some of the eighties’ most stylish, haunting, and outrageous visions.\n\nStart watching on the Criterion Channel beginning October 1!

    "description": "1972 Spanish/British horror film. This great and largely overlooked team up of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing got this rave review on IMD by Coventry:\n\nPardon my enthusiasm but HORROR EXPRESS really is a must see for all fans of classic horror. It simply is one of the best horror movies made in the seventies and I can't think of many aspects about it that are negative. First of all it stars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. There.that should already be enough as a recommendation. These gentlemen are one THE greatest duo in horror ever and they didn't do their finest work just for Hammer Studio's exclusively. And the fun doesn't stop with these two icons.Horror Express also stars Telly `Kojak' Savalas in a delightful role. It's actually a shame that his screentime is rather limited because he manages to impress as much as Lee and Cushing. He clearly enjoyed playing Captain Kazan and he makes the most of his performance.\n\nBut Horror Express has a lot more to offer than just good acting. It's a powerful and fascinating story that delivers a good old fashioned amount of scares and atmosphere. The entire story takes place on a old train which is the ideal setting for a film like this. The old and noisy carriages create a unique atmosphere of claustrophobia and the `nowhere to run'-element is used to the max. The plotline itself surprisingly good and it keeps you alert during the entire movie. This is also thanks to the several other, interesting topics that are included in the movie like anthropology, religion and the evolution-theory. Sure, the entire screenplay is illogical and the plot contains as many holes as a small Swiss cheese but - seriously - who cares. I prefer this kind of silly inspiration and creativity a million times over the horror crap they make nowadays !! Horror Express is - simply put - a must see ! I'd even say it's essential viewing if you're looking for the highlights in the genre. It's original, creepy ( even pretty bloody and violent ), it contains enough humor to moderate things and most of all.it's very entertaining. Climb on board and find yourself a seat.Horror Express is one movie you won't regret watching !!",

Nor does it contain what often get labeled as police, spy, political, survival, and other kinds of thrillers unless an element of the macabre exists.\nIt does contain in some cases what could be categorized as adventure, science fiction, mystery, drama, and even documentary.  The fact is many selections are cross-genre.  There's a very fine line on some choices as well as some great movies not chosen some may think of as thrillers.\nI stayed true to my personal choices, not polls.  Listed in no particular order.",

    "description": "I was lucky enough to be the child of parents that didn’t really police what I watched (within reason… ish). Some of my warmest memories are of my mother and I going to our local video store (The Video Station) and spending an hour or more picking a bunch of movies to take home (and also renting a giant VCR as we didn’t own one). I still remember the distinct smell of that place, which I naturally associated with happiness. I spent all of my time in the Horror section, which was surprisingly large for a small town family-owned video shop, and offered films from all over the world.\n\nAt some point I discovered that they sold a large catalog of the films their distributor offered. Each film included a synopsis, year, rating, genres, director, and occasionally a one-sentence review. The catalog was $12, a pretty steep fee considering we were actually quite poor. My mother noticed that I always returned to it to look up movies and surprised me one day with my very own copy.\n\nI read it like a book and circled every film I wanted to see, then would dog-ear the pages with circled films. On our trips to The Video Station I would bring the catalog with me and use it as a reference to pick my movies for the day. Salem’s Lot was one of those films, yet they never had the video in stock. It was always rented out.\n\nI know I had already seen it on television, but I was much younger and could remember just one scene: the kitchen scene. I would have been just six-years-old when it originally aired in 1979 and probably hadn’t yet developed a taste for Horror, but that one scene undoubtedly played an integral role in my love of the genre.\n\nI didn’t choose to feature that scene because so many people have suggested the scene that I did feature (I’ll bet you can guess which scene it is). I’d love to hear what you think!

    "description": "The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a 1975 British-American musical comedy horror film directed by Jim Sharman. The screenplay was written by Sharman and Richard O'Brien based on the 1973 musical stage production, The Rocky Horror Show, music, book and lyrics by O'Brien. The production is a satirical tribute to the science fiction and horror B movies of the late 1930s through early 1970s. The film stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick along with cast members from the original Royal Court Theatre, Roxy Theatre and Belasco Theatre productions.\n\nThe film was shot in the United Kingdom at Bray Studios and on location at an old country estate named Oakley Court, best known for its use in old Hammer Horror productions. A number of props and set pieces were reused from old Hammer films. Although the movie is both a send-up and tribute to many of the science fiction and horror movies from the 1930s up to the 1970s, costume designer Sue Blane conducted no research for her designs. Blane stated that costumes from the film have directly impacted the development of punk music fashion trends such as ripped fishnets and dyed hair.\n\nAlthough largely panned upon release, it soon gained notoriety as a midnight movie when audiences began participating with the film at the Waverly Theater in New York City in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. Still in limited release nearly four decades after its premiere, it has the longest-running theatrical release in film history. Today, the film has a large international cult following and is one of the most well-known and financially successful midnight movies of all time. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2005.\n\nIn this cult classic, sweethearts Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon), stuck with a flat tire during a storm, discover the eerie mansion of Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite scientist. As their innocence is lost, Brad and Janet meet a houseful of wild characters, including a rocking biker (Meat Loaf) and a creepy butler (Richard O'Brien). Through elaborate dances and rock songs, Frank-N-Furter unveils his latest creation: a muscular man named \"Rocky.\"\n\nTO BUY THE ORIGINAL POSTER FOR THIS FILM JUST VISIT www.picturepalacemovieposters.com TODAY!",

    "title": "Best Horror Scenes: Night of the Living Dead (1968)",
    "url": "https://vimeo.com/638095831",
    "description": "I first saw Night of the Living Dead when I was around 9-years-old, but it wasn’t the full film. A comedy troupe called The L.A. Connection had a short-lived television show called Mad Movies [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Movies_with_the_L.A._Connection] (which predated Mystery Science Theater 3000 by a few years) where they would take beloved classic films, edit them down to 20 minutes, and re-dub all new dialogue, always turning the original story completely on its head. For example, they once did The Little Princess (1939) starring Shirley Temple, making Temple possessed by a doll, and only a song-and-dance exorcism can save her.\n\nFor Night of the Living Dead [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3yfXyG4oE], Barbara is throwing a surprise birthday party for herself and the zombies are party goers that arrive too early, throwing Barbara into a frenzy because she didn’t have anything cute to wear and she’s out of lettuce. Every time it cut to a shot of the zombies approaching the house or sticking their arms through windows you would hear them all saying, “surpriiiiisse…” in a mumbled, deadpan tone. It was magical.\n\nFor whatever reason the film was never on my radar, even though I knew full well that it was a major milestone in Horror history. I didn’t see the full film until I was a good bit older. I can’t put my finger on it, but despite the terrible practical effects; the sub-par acting; the amateur framing in many scenes; the terrible sound; the canned music; despite all of the things that will usually ruin any chance of disassociating while watching a film, I really enjoyed it. And while I didn’t really feel it was at all scary, there was a unique sense of anxiety and danger underlining the entire film from frame one. I think the high-contrast black-and-white print also played a major role in its success, and the setting itself — a remote country farmhouse — definitely contributed to the claustrophobia.\n\nNight of the Living Dead is one of the most successful independent films of all time, by quite a long shot. The final budget for the film was $114,000 (equivalent to $847,400 in 2020), and it grossed approximately $30,000,000 (equivalent to $223,600,000 in 2020) — over 263 times its budget. Despite its record-making successes, director George A. Romero saw very little of the profit as he didn’t include a copyright at the end of the film. Laws at the time stated this was a requirement, and because he missed it the film almost immediately went into the public domain (which is why you often see it playing on TVs in other Horror films, such as the original Halloween).\n\nAnd let’s not get started on the fact that this single film is responsible for creating an entire universe of Horror sub-genres, and that many modern day zombie films still adhere to the guidelines set forth by George A. Romero and his crew all of those years ago (zombies are cannibals; they move slowly; they simply adore brains; and you have to shoot them in the head to kill them).\n\nIt’s for these reasons that I consider Night of the Living Dead untouchable. Un-review-able. Un-critique-able. Precious, even. And it goes without saying, a must-see film for the Horror completist.\n\nView all scenes at https://besthorrorscenes.com\n\n+ + + + + +\n\n“Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't necessarily \"horror\" but have elements or threads of horror, and all have the same general effect: unease, dread, fear, shock, disgust.\n\nIf you have recommendations for scenes to include please feel free to suggest via comments or by contacting me!\n\n* Obvious footnote: Clips may contain spoilers!",

    "description": "Jackie “Moms” Mabley emerged from the Chitlin’ Circuit of African-American vaudeville to become a pioneer in mainstream comedy. Once billed as “The Funniest Woman in the World,” Mabley pushed the boundaries of comedy by tackling topics such as gender, sex, and racism and performed up until her death in 1975. Whoopi Goldberg pays tribute to Moms Mabley in this 2013 documentary, which features vintage clips and recordings of Mabley, as well as recent interviews with some of the world’s top comedians, including Eddie Murphy, Joan Rivers, Kathy Griffin, and Robert Klein. A true passion project for first-time director Goldberg, the documentary shows Mabley’s historical significance and profound influence as a performer vastly ahead of her time.\n\nBambi Haggins (Film and Media Studies, UC Irvine), who is featured in the film and served as a consultant to Goldberg, joined moderator Patrice Petro for a post-screening discussion.\n\nhe CWC series “Women in Comedy” showcases the achievement of women in American film and television comedy. At a time when comedy across all media remains dominated by men, female comedians have achieved unprecedented visibility as artists, writers, producers, and performers. Women comedians have produced enduring works of humor as a means of self-expression, artistic innovation, and political intervention.",

    "description": "When school let out in May of 1980, film was loaded into the Bolex I'd purchased 5 months before and shooting began. That summer, friends John Cosentino and Ted Rae came down from Michigan and helped me with shooting the shots of my father crawling in the matte painted desert. John and Ted both felt using my dad would be perfect ( I was originally going to use John as the Low Plains Drifter). I also recall Ted’s excellent suggestion of shooting some close up shots of the crawling man. ( I had only storyboarded medium and wide shots). \n\nBy the time I turned 21 at the end of 1980, Mom and Dad told me had to get a full time paying job if I wanted to stay at home where I grew up. I didn't want to give up the basement animation studio which was vital to finishing the film (plus, the home cooking was great) so getting the film done took a little longer as it had to be balanced with a day job at a sign painting company. Mom probably thought I would endlessly be doing shots over and over again if that’s all I had to do (and she was probably right). So, the old artist’s bromide \"if it sucks, do it over again” had to be ignored on some occasions so the film could be completed in a reasonable amount of time (which turned out to be a year, anyway)\n\nDiscovery of an unprojected HIGHRISE print last year created some interest in trying to restore the film as much as possible. I like the idea that films are locked into the times they are made in, so aside from painting out many\ndirt specks and reducing some flicker and grain, I resisted the temptation to do a “special edition”. A couple of the matte paintings are real stinkers, but maybe they are just scars from the limitations and lack of experience. The availability of home computers running Photoshop, After Effects was still a solid ten years in the future, so the visual effects were made simply from materials brought home from the local hardware store.",

Roman Kachanov.  A trio of intrepid space explorers, Professor Seleznyov, his 9-year old daughter Alisa and the hilariously doom-and-gloom Captain Zelyonyy set off on a rocket ship in the year 2181 to collect rare alien creatures for the Moscow Zoo.  They’re immediately drawn into an amazingly convoluted mystery involving a sinister doctor named Verkhovtsev, a nearly-extinct Chatter-bird, and two legendary missing cosmonauts, while galaxy hopping from one wildly colorful planet to the next.  A delirious cosmic treat for fans of FANTASTIC PLANET and DELTA SPACE MISSION, MYSTERY… features a gallery of psychedelic space creatures straight out of YELLOW SUBMARINE.  Based on “Alisa’s Voyage” by famed sci-fi author Kir Bulychev, Kachanov’s long sought-after gem packs enough plot, surreal imagery, and otherworldly worlds into its 48 minutes for an entire mini-series.  In Russian with English subtitles.\nTHE RETURN (VOZVRASHCHENIE), 1980, Soyuzmultfilm, 10 min. – In Vladimir Tarasov's mind bending psychedelic masterpiece, a sleeping cosmonaut hurtles unaware towards his home planet -- but will he awake in time?  Newly restored by Deaf Crocodile.\nTHE PASS (PEREVAL), 1988, Soyuzmultfilm, 30 min.  “On this night, Oleg was on duty near the fence … He sensed the emptiness and the routine.  Three times people went to the Pass.  It was all in vain.”  So begins Russian director Vladimir Tarasov’s sublime masterpiece of animated sci-fi in which a group of terrified human survivors on an alien world try to reach their derelict spacecraft 16 years after it crashed.  On par with Tarkovsky’s SOLARIS and STALKER as one of the most hypnotic and visually stunning science-fiction stories ever filmed, THE PASS is filled with cascading, pulsating images:  night creatures that bleed in from the darkness to attack, a cat’s eyes flickering in the candlelight, frightened children reciting stories of another planet, another time.  THE PASS is the longest of Tarasov’s works and arguably his finest achievement, adapted from the first chapter in sci-fi author Kir Bulychev’s novel “The Settlement.”  Both films were newly restored by Deaf Crocodile for their first-ever U.S. Blu-ray release.  Co-presented with Seagull Films. In Russian with English subtitles.\n\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nTwo new video essays on Roman Kachanov and Vladimir Tarasov by film historian Evan Chester\nNew commentary track by Adam Rackoff, James Hancock and Martin Kessler\nNew artwork by Beth Morris.\nBlu-ray authoring by David Mackenzie of Fidelity In Motion\n\n\nDeluxe Edition Bonus Content:\n\nLimited to 1250 units\nSlipcase featuring new artwork by Haleigh Buck\n60-page illustrated book\nNew essay by film historian & professor Jennifer Lynde Barker\nNew essay by film critic Walter Chaw (Film Freak Central)",

    "description": "\"An old juvenile court judge named McKesson, who keeps referring to himself as \"we\" and \"us,\" decides he wants to find out about drugs. The judge says this to the camera, but the words he mouths bear absolutely no relation to the words on the soundtrack. He drives to a house where he meets \"Phyllis,\" a teenager who tells us (also out-of-synch) that when you smoke marijuana \"everything speeds up to 100 miles an hour!\" She meets \"Chuck\" (who is a \"hype\" and a \"peddler\") and starts wearing lipstick, becomes a junkie, loses her looks, goes through withdrawl (some good histrionics here) and reforms. Judge McKesson then tells us that the Russians are promoting drug traffic in the United States to \"undermine national morale,\" and that the only way we can stop the spread of drug use is by using \"good sense.\" The film concludes with a newspaper headline -- \"America's Teen Age Dope 'Fad' Ending!\" Another unique Sid Davis production.\n\n\"This is the home of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Howard. They just got their teenage daughter back after a six-month nightmare that even Edgar Allan Poe couldn't have improved upon.\" With that we plunge deep into the underside of Los Angeles youth culture in the early fifties. In many of his films, Sid Davis explored the perils awaiting children and adolescents in the great city of Los Angeles, full of \"hypes,\" \"peddlers\" and \"dangerous strangers.\" This time, with the disapproving figure of Judge William B. McKesson as our guide, we follow Phyllis Howard on her journey to hell and back.\nThere are ecstatic moments on Phyllis's journey, like her drive up into the mountains when she smokes reefer and \"everything speeds up to a hundred miles per hour.\" There are also hellish moments, like her cold turkey withdrawal behind bars in the county jail. The film mixes documentary realism (shot on the streets of Hollywood and downtown L.A.) with sensational narration. \"Some say the Reds are promoting dope traffic in the United States to undermine national morale,\" says the judge/narrator. \"They did it in China a few years back. It's certainly true that the increased use of narcotics plays right into their hands.\"\nWell before most other educational film producers, Davis made films about sensitive subjects like drug abuse and child molestation. This made him a genuine pioneer, as he had to navigate territory without a body of previous work to emulate. It also meant that he had constantly to address issues of disbelief and denial. As Judge McKesson asks at the end of the film, \"Well, that's Phyllis's story. In the United States of America, 20th century. Unbelievable, isn't it, that such things can happen?\"\nFrom the producer's description:\n\"All over the United States, committees of parents and educators are meeting to determine what can be done to combat the greatest menace ever to peril the welfare of American youth: Narcotic addiction. All agree that something besides stricter enforcement of the drug laws is needed. That 'something' is Education. Teen-age boys and girls must be educated to the shocking consequences of 'playing around' with narcotics!\n\"It has been proved over and over again that there is no more effective medium of education than the motion picture. The first step in an educational program to fight drug addiction is an effective educational film.\n\"The Terrible Truth documents the tragic story of one teen-age girl, typical of youthful addicts. Starting with an occasional marijuana cigarette, she is induced to experiment with a 'fix' of heroin. In a few days, she is [a] hopeless 'hype,' ends up with a criminal record and a blighted future. Local and national government studies are cited to show that almost 100 per cent of youthful addicts eventually turn to crime to get money to satisfy their 'habit.'\n\"It is the responsibility of every community, large or small, to protect its youth against this tragic, appalling menace. Whether a city or town has already experienced the disaster of teen-age drug usage, or whether it has so far escaped being touched, the problem is the same: To educate boys and girls against narcotic usage before it is too late, before more lives and futures are forfeit. No community is safe, so long as the 'fad' is allowed to exist anywhere.\" (https://archive.org/details/Terrible1951)",

    "description": "Archive events are in Pacific Time (U.S.).\n\nThis is a one-time live screening.\nThe Classic Ghosts: “The Haunting of Rosalind”\n\nU.S., 4/10/1973\n\nIn a landmark broadcast career spanning over four decades, producer and director Lela Swift helmed hundreds of hours of television, including close to 600 episodes (nearly half of the entire run) of ABC's cult-favorite horror soap opera, Dark Shadows. Starting as a gopher before becoming a research assistant at CBS in the 1940s, Swift advanced to become a successful assistant director for the network before hitting a glass ceiling and being continuously denied promotion to director. Encouraged to enter the field of casting, where women were \"welcome\" in the industry, Swift held firm to eventually break through as one of the first women to direct primetime network television programming.\n\nSwift’s pioneering work for CBS included directing episodes of the early anthologies Studio One, Suspense, and The Web, where she directed James Dean in one of his first roles. During the late 1950s and early ‘60s, Swift's career progressed as she directed installments of The DuPont Show of the Week, the social-issue serial The House on High Street, and several acclaimed episodes of NBC's Purex Specials for Women. By the mid-1970s and through the late 1980s, Swift's prolific work in daytime TV would come to define her esteemed legacy in television, as she went on to direct over 800 episodes of ABC's popular soap, Ryan's Hope, for which she would earn three Daytime Emmy Awards.\n\nBeyond Dark Shadows, Swift’s extensive resume boasts numerous horror entries including the 1973 telefilm The Classic Ghosts: “The Haunting of Rosalind,” one of several such works she directed as part of ABC's “Wide World of Mystery” late-night programming experiment. The gothic, Dark Shadows-esque “Rosalind” concerns two sisters (Pamela Payton-Wright and future Academy Award-winner Susan Sarandon) whose affections for the same suitor (Frank Converse) leads to a tragic disruption between the worlds of the living and the dead. Produced on videotape by Swift’s fellow trailblazer, Jacqueline Babbin, “The Haunting of Rosalind” stands today as a moody, atmospheric time capsule of ‘70s television horror (with associated frights and chills) and a lasting testament to the extreme talents of the women who made it.\n\nProgram notes written by Mark Quigley, John H. Mitchell Television Curator.\n\nPost-screening conversation with Archive Research and Study Center Officer Maya Montañez Smukler, author of Liberating Hollywood: Women Directors and the Feminist Reform of 1970s American Cinema, and Amanda Reyes, editor of Are You in the House Alone?: A TV Movie Compendium 1964-1999 and host of the podcast Made for TV Mayhem.\n\nColor, approx. 70 min. ABC. A Specter Production. Executive Producer: Robert Berger. Producer: Jacqueline Babbin. Director: Lela Swift. Writer: Art Wallace. Based on a story by Henry James. With: Pamela Payton-Wright, Susan Sarandon, Beatrice Straight, Frank Converse.\n\nPreserved from the original 2 in. videotape. Video transfer at DC Video. Engineering services by David Crosthwait.\n\nTotal program runtime, including discussion: approx. 110 min.\n\nThis screening is presented strictly for educational purposes only as part of UCLA’s mission to serve the public and academia.

    "description": "Daylight Multimedia and the Center for Documentary Studies are proud to present the work of Nandita Raman, the winner of the first annual Daylight / CDS Photo Awards. Raman's Cinema Playhouse series focuses on the interiors of decaying theaters in India. Built between 1930 and 1960, these theaters, brimming with eccentricity, have largely been replaced by generic multiplexes. Through her quiet and beautiful images, Raman explores her childhood memories and the idiosyncrasies of the Golden Age of Bollywood.\n\nAs the winner of the Project Prize, Nandita Raman's work will be on view from September 13–December 23, 2010 at the Center for Documentary Studies in Durham, NC. Please join us for the opening reception Thursday, September 23, 6–9pm. For more check out: http://cds.aas.duke.edu/",

    "url": "https://vimeo.com/917961000",
    "description": "THE VALIANT ONES; King Hu’s last great masterpiece from the golden age of wuxia cinema; will be released on Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, presented from a brand new 4K restoration.  Available as part of the Masters of Cinema Series from 27 May 2024 in the UK (home video debut), and from 28 May 2024 in North America, the first print run of 2000 copies of each format in each territory will feature a Limited edition O-card slipcase.\n\nTHE VALIANT ONES is perhaps the last true wuxia film directed by celebrated Taiwanese filmmaker King Hu, an undisputed master of the genre. Shot back-to-back with THE FATE OF LEE KHAN (but not released until two years later), it stands as a worthy follow-up to his earlier works COME DRINK WITH ME, DRAGON INN and A TOUCH OF ZEN.\n\nDuring the reign of the Jiajing Emperor (Chao Lei), China’s coastal regions have come under attack by wokou – Japanese pirates under the leadership of the infamous Hakatatsu (Sammo Hung). To combat this threat, the Emperor tasks a trusted general, Zhu Wan (Tu Kuang-chi), with assembling a group of skilled warriors to find and eliminate the pirates. Under the command of General Yu Dayou (Roy Chiao), the band of soldiers – including husband-and-wife sword-fighters Wu Ji-yuan (Wing Bai) and Wu Ruo-shi (Feng Hsu) – set out to draw Hakatatsu, his ally Xu Dong (Han Ying-chieh) and their pirate clan into a series of spectacular showdowns.\n\nInspired by historical events and featuring several storied figures drawn from Chinese history, THE VALIANT ONES is a standout wuxia film produced during the dying days of the genre, as audience tastes were shifting towards more grounded kung fu cinema. The Masters of Cinema series is proud to present the film on Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray from a 4K restoration.\n\nSPECIAL EDITION BLU-RAY FEATURES:\nLimited edition O-card slipcase featuring new artwork by Grégory Sacré (Gokaiju) [First print run of 2000 copies only] | 1080p HD presentation on Blu-ray from a 4K digital restoration of  the original negatives gifted by director King Hu to the Hong Kong Film Archive | Uncompressed original Mandarin mono restored from the original soundtrack negative | Optional English subtitles newly translated for this release | Brand new audio commentary by Asian film expert Frank Djeng (NY Asian Film Festival) | TONY RAYNS ON THE VALIANT ONES – Brand new interview with critic and Asian film expert Tony Rayns | TSAR OF ALL THE WUXIA - Brand new video essay by David Cairns | THE LIFE OF A LUCKY STUNTMAN – Brand new interview with stuntman Billy Chan | MY FATHER AND I – Brand new interview with actor Ng Ming-choi | Archival 2003 interview with actress Hsu Feng by Frédéric Ambroisine | Archival 2003 interview with Roger Garcia (Hong Kong International Film Festival Society) by Frédéric Ambroisine | Archival 2016 interview with actor Ng Ming-choi by Frédéric Ambroisine | PLUS: A collector’s booklet featuring new writing on the film by Jonathan Clements\n\nSPECIAL EDITION 4K ULTRA HD BLU-RAY FEATURES:\nLimited edition O-card slipcase featuring new artwork by Grégory Sacré (Gokaiju) [First print run of 2000 copies only] | 4K (2160p) UHD Blu-ray presentation, presented in Dolby Vision HDR from a 4K digital restoration of  the original negatives gifted by director King Hu to the Hong Kong Film Archive | Uncompressed original Mandarin mono restored from the original soundtrack negative | Optional English subtitles newly translated for this release | Brand new audio commentary by Asian film expert Frank Djeng (NY Asian Film Festival) | TONY RAYNS ON THE VALIANT ONES – Brand new interview with critic and Asian film expert Tony Rayns | TSAR OF ALL THE WUXIA - Brand new video essay by David Cairns | THE LIFE OF A LUCKY STUNTMAN – Brand new interview with stuntman Billy Chan | MY FATHER AND I – Brand new interview with actor Ng Ming-choi | Archival 2003 interview with actress Hsu Feng by Frédéric Ambroisine | Archival 2003 interview with Roger Garcia (Hong Kong International Film Festival Society) by Frédéric Ambroisine | Archival 2016 interview with actor Ng Ming-choi by Frédéric Ambroisine | PLUS: A collector’s booklet featuring new writing on the film by Jonathan Clements",

    "description": "An iconic early horror masterpiece, DER GOLEM was Paul Wegener’s third attempt at adapting the Golem character for the big screen. Starring and co-directing with Carl Boese, Wegener crafted one of silent cinema’s most enduring masterpieces. \n\nIn the Jewish ghetto in 16th century Prague, Rabbi Low (Albert Streinruck, ASPHALT) creates a forbidding clay Golem (played by director Paul Wegener) to protect his people from the tyrannical Emperor Luhois (Otto Gebuhr). Brought to life with a demon spirit and an amulet placed in the centre of the creature’s chest, the Golem is a seemingly indestructible juggernaut, performing acts of great heroism. But when the Rabbi’s assistant attempts to control the Golem for selfish gain, it becomes a terrifying force of destruction, rampaging through the ghetto leaving fire and death in its wake. \n\nA landmark film in the horror canon, influencing most notably James Whale’s 1931 adaptation of FRANKENSTEIN, DER GOLEM, wie er in die Welt kam is also a pre-eminent example of German Expressionism, and an important contribution to the golden age of Weimar Cinema. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present the film in its UK debut on Blu-ray from a brand new 4K restoration.",

    "description": "A high point in the already success-laden career of writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz (A Letter to Three Wives, All About Eve), and one of the most glamorous and extravagant films from Hollywood’s Golden Age, The Barefoot Contessa is a tragic drama about the tumultuous rise and fall of fictional Hollywood actress Maria Vargas (Ava Gardner).\n\nHumphrey Bogart plays down on his luck writer and director Harry Dawes, reduced to working for an egotistical and abusive producer, Kirk Edwards (Warren Stevens).  Whilst scouting for the female lead in his new movie, Dawes meets the beautiful and charismatic Maria Vargas, a barefooted flamenco dancer, in a Madrid night club and convinces her to star in his movie. Maria is an overnight sensation, but cannot find satisfaction in the shallow world of Hollywood, and the men in her life who treat her as nothing more than a commodity.\n \nAlso featuring Edmund O’Brien in an Oscar winning role as a duplicitous publicist, and featuring cinematography from the legendary Jack Cardiff, The Barefoot Contessa was a massive success upon release, and The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present the film in a special Dual Format edition, that includes the film on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK.",
