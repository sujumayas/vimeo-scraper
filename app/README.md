# Vimeo Classic Movies Browser

A simple web application for browsing and watching classic movies from Vimeo, built with React and the esen-ds-minimal design system.

## Features

- 📽️ Browse classic movies from Vimeo
- 🔍 Search by title, description, or creator
- 🎬 Embedded video player for instant playback
- 🌓 Dark/light mode toggle
- 📱 Responsive grid layout
- 🎨 Minimal, clean design using monospace fonts

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000` and automatically load movies from `/outputs/vimeo_old_movies.json`.

## Build

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## How It Works

1. The app loads movie data from `/outputs/vimeo_old_movies.json` (generated by the Python scrapers)
2. Movies are displayed in a responsive grid with thumbnails
3. Click any movie card to watch it in the embedded player
4. Search functionality filters movies in real-time
5. Click "Open on Vimeo" to view the video on Vimeo's website

## Design System

This app uses components from `/app/esen-ds-minimal`:
- `Page`, `PageHeader`, `Section` - Layout components
- `Button`, `Input`, `Toolbar` - Form controls
- `Badge` - Status indicators
- `ThemeProvider` - Dark/light mode support

All components use Tailwind CSS with a consistent 3px border radius and monospace typography.
